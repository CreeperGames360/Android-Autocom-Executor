Q&A:
Q: My android device won't boot into bootloader mode. Why is this?
A: If "adb reboot bootloader" doesn't work, it's possible that your bootloader is locked, or your device may not support unlocking the bootloader. Try and check on a device specific forum to see if there is a bootloader button combination specifically for your device. I don't know what device you use.

Q: My device wont remount system RW! Why doesn't it work?
A: This is possibly because either you haven't rooted your device (which would void your warranty, so I don't recommend rooting if you have warranty.), or aren't running a custom ROM. If so, there's a script in here to root your device. Just know it doesn't work for android versions over 4.2.

Q: My device isn't detected by my PC. help! i want to flash a custom recovery...
A: Probably don't have correct drivers. Try and go to THESE official websites at the bottom to download drivers for your brand.
https://en-us.support.motorola.com/app/usb-drivers (Motorola Drivers)
https://developer.samsung.com/android-usb-driver (Samsung Drivers)
https://xiaomidriver.com/ (Xiaomi Drivers)
https://www.lg.com/us/support/software-firmware-drivers (LGâœž Drivers)
After downloading the appropriate drivers for your device brand, install them on your PC. This will most likely register your device on your PC now.
